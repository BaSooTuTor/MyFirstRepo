# Brief Introduction About Myself

Hi! My name is Abdulbasit Sharaf. I'm currently learning Git and GitHub through this project.  
I'm passionate about technology and want to gain hands-on experience in version control.  

This repository is my first step into collaborative development, and I'm excited to learn more!
